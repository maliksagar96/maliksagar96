### 🚧 Currently Working Directories

- 🧠 **FDTD (C++)(https://github.com/maliksagar96/FDTD.git)**  
  Solving Maxwell's equations using FDTD sovler. 

- 🧱 **CUDA(https://github.com/maliksagar96/CUDA.git)**  
  Learning CUDA so that I can optimise my solver and other codes. 

- 🌐 **DSA(https://github.com/maliksagar96/DSA.git)**  
  Actively learning DSA for better understanding and implementation of physics based solvers.

### ✅ Completed Projects

- 📂 **[VTK-reader](https://github.com/maliksagar96/VTK-reader.git)**  
  C++ library using VTK to read `.vtk` PolyData and UnstructuredGrid files, extract points, connectivity, scalars, and vectors

- 📂 **[VTK-writer](https://github.com/maliksagar96/VTK-writer.git)**  
  C++ library using VTK to write `.vtk` UnstructuredGrid files for triangle and quad meshes, with support for scalar and vector fields

- 📂 **[MPI](https://github.com/maliksagar96/MPI.git)**  
  Collection of simple MPI examples in C++, including vector addition, array sum, and matrix multiplication. Each example demonstrates key MPI functions (`Scatter`, `Gather`, `Reduce`, `Bcast`) with performance insights and comparisons to serial and CUDA implementations.
