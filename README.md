### 🧠 Featured Work

- ⚡ **[CUDA](https://github.com/maliksagar96/CUDA.git)**  
  A playground of CUDA experiments — from vector operations and stencil computations to GPU-accelerated FDTD prototypes. Focused on learning, profiling, and optimizing performance-critical kernels.

- 📂 **[MPI](https://github.com/maliksagar96/MPI.git)**  
  Collection of simple MPI examples in C++, including vector addition, array sum, and matrix multiplication. Each example demonstrates key MPI functions (`Scatter`, `Gather`, `Reduce`, `Bcast`) with performance insights and comparisons to serial and CUDA implementations.

- 📂 **[VTK-reader](https://github.com/maliksagar96/VTK-reader.git)**  
  C++ library using VTK to read `.vtk` PolyData and UnstructuredGrid files, extract points, connectivity, scalars, and vectors.

- 📂 **[VTK-writer](https://github.com/maliksagar96/VTK-writer.git)**  
  C++ library using VTK to write `.vtk` UnstructuredGrid files for triangle and quad meshes, with support for scalar and vector fields.

- 🧠 **[FDTD (C++)](https://github.com/maliksagar96/FDTD.git)**  
  Solving Maxwell's equations using an in-house FDTD solver.
